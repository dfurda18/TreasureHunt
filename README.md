# TreasureHunt
Small console project made for an in-house Game Jam at NBCC Game Development.

This Game Jam was organized by the NBCC - Game Development students to practice after the first Fall term. The only experience they had at this moment was to create games with console output.

The GJ's restrictions were to build a console game with the theme **Treasure Hunt**.

Treasure Runner is an Auto-run platformer where all levels are located within a map. The objective is for the player to find the trasure hidden within the island.

Each time the player travels to a new node, they must run certain distance. As the player goes north, the distances become larger, with more enemies and faster. The player has only five lives and falling into a pit is game over.

In retrospective, the game can have many gameplay adjustments to make the game easier to beat. Like reseting lives each level, or gaining lives as the player reaches certain distances.

The key is giving priority to the pits and watch out when they are at the larges size because the timing must be almost perfect.

This was a project that helped me understanding how to stream a random level and implementing graphs in a game.

The code can have many design improvements like modulating the pages and having a page manager.
